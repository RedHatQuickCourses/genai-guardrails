= Lab: Output Guardrails

In the previous lab, you checked the **input** text in a chatbot and verified the safety of it using the IBM Granite Guardian model. 

In this lab, you will check the response text from an LLM and verify if it is safe to send it back to the user. You will run the `granite3-guardian:2b` LLM model using `ollama`.

NOTE: We do not run any inference LLM model in this lab, and we restrict ourselves to checking outputs. We mock the response from the LLM and send both the input and output as context to the Guardian model for checking.

## Pre-requistes

* Python v3.12 or higher (The labs in this course were tested with Python 3.12 on macOS)
* The `pip` CLI to install Python libraries
* Git CLI to clone the sample code from GitHub
* Visual Studio Code or other editors to edit Python code
* ollama runtime to run the Guardian model (IBM Granite Guardian v3)
** Install ollama for your platform and start it by following the instructions at https://ollama.com/download

## Steps

. If you have not already done it, clone the Git repository containing the code to a folder of your choice.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *git clone https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/genai-apps.git*
--

. All the code for IBM Granite Guardian is in a folder called `guardrails/granite-guardian`. Change to this folder in the terminal.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *cd genai-apps/guardrails/granite-guardian*
--

. Activate the virtual environment you created in the previous lab. If you have not created a virtual environment, refer to the previous lab to create it.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *source venv/bin/activate*
--
+
Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now running in an isolated virtual environment.

. If you have not done it previously, install all the needed dependencies using `pip install`. It will take some time to compile native libraries and install all the dependencies for your platform.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *pip install -r requirements.txt*
--

. If you have not done this already, you should have pulled (downloaded) the `granite3-guardian:2b` model using ollama. You must have installed and started the ollama service as outlined in the pre-requisites section. 
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *ollama pull granite3-guardian:2b*
--

. Inspect the `guardian-response.py` file in the editor of your choice. The `main()` tests three different scenarios where the mocked inputs from the user and the response from the LLM are checked for harmful content.

. The **scenario1()** method sends the user input and a sample mocked response from an LLM to the Guardian model for evaluation.

<1> The sample user input
<2> A sample mocked LLM response
<3> If the Guardian model returns **No**, mark the response as safe
<4> If the Guardian models returns any other output other than **No**, mark the response as not safe

. Run the `guardian-response.py` in the virtual environment.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *python guardian-response.py*
Scenario1 Analysis: ❌ Response from LLM is considered harmful! Blocking further processing...
--
+
The Guardian model has rightly flagged the LLM response as harmful.

. Inspect the **scenario2()** and **scenario3()** methods. Uncomment the method calls in the **main()** function:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    scenario1()
    *scenario2()
    scenario3()*
--

. Run the `guardian-response.py` in the virtual environment once again.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *python guardian-response.py*
Scenario1 Analysis: ❌ Response from LLM is considered harmful! Blocking further processing...

Scenario2 Analysis: ✅ Response from LLM is safe! You can send it to the Inference server...

Scenario3 Analysis: ✅ Response from LLM is safe! You can send it to the Inference server...
--
+
The response from **scenario2()** and **scenario3()** is marked safe.

. Now, change the `response_text` variable in **scenario3()** method to **I don't like Klingon people, so I would suggest avoiding it!**.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...
def scenario3():

    user_text = "What is your opinion on Klingon cuisine?"
    *response_text = """I don't like Klingon people, so I would suggest avoiding it!"""*
...
--

. Re-run the script again in the venv.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ (venv) *python guardian-response.py*
Scenario1 Analysis: ❌ Response from LLM is considered harmful! Blocking further processing...

Scenario2 Analysis: ✅ Response from LLM is safe! You can send it to the Inference server...

Scenario3 Analysis: ❌ Response from LLM is considered harmful! Blocking further processing...
--
+
**scenario3()** now fails because the Guardian model has determined that the LLM response about Klingon's contains social bias.
